<p>The <stronbr> Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language</strong> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
<br> <br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
